# Quickhat

Quickhat is a simple CLI to quickly generate a [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) typescript project.

## Usage

```bash
npx quickhat
```

## Reason for this project

I got fed up with how hardhat make you install dependencies manually in multiple waves

This CLI will:
- Install all the required dependencies in one shot
- Add an EMPTY sample contract
- Add an EMPTY sample test
- Add an EMPTY sample deployment script
- Add a hardhat config with common network configurations
- Set up proper .env private key management
